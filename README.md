Arduino_MobileDevice
====================

/// Development of a mobile device based off of Arduino hardware.

Arduino is a quick and easy way to get a hardware electronics projects up and running. With so many modules (hardware and software) readily available, assembly and implementation is more educational than laborious. With this in mind, I wanted to choose an Arduino project that still brought an element of challenge while giving the final product a few extra points of awe. 

/// Define the project

The project is an Arduino based mobile phone. A website lays out an exampled implementation of one such phone. A list of suggested parts and an example software GUI is presented at the following site:

http://www.instructables.com/id/ArduinoPhone/

The result is a bulky but still very cool. The design itself is rather bulky but cool nonetheless. It shall have a touch screen at its user interface while utilizing GPRS for its communication needs.

/// Collect the materials

Parts include the following:
	- TFT Touch Shield
	- Antenna
	- GPRS shield (STM900)
	- UNO Arduino processor
	- Lithium Polymer power module
	- Battery housing
	- Appropriate harnessing
	- Body/ Case (TBD)
	- SIM card
